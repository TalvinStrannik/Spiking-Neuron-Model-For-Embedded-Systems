# Spiking-Neuron-Model-For-Embedded-Systems
Joint project with S. Yablonsky and V. Lutkovsky. July 2023 - October 2023

I reported and defended our work at an international conference in which 12 countries took part, PRIP'23 in English.

It was more theoretical work. Here is an example of how we wanted to solve the problem of voice recognition without the Fourier transform at all! We took measurements, collected statistics, trained a simple model and configured the parameters in the MCU. It's simple and it works! This is called a spiking neural network. We offered our model!
